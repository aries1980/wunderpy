wunderpy
========

The goal of this project is to make [Wunderlist's](https://wunderlist.com) private and undocumented API less private and better documented, while also providing a python client implementation. I've explained how I figured out the API in a blog post [here](http://bsmt.me/blog/2013/03/02/reverse-engineering-the-wunderlist-api/), in case anyone is curious or wants to contribute.

You can read the documentation at [readthedocs.](https://wunderpy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)

Building the Docs
-----------------

Chances are, you're looking for information on how to use the API. I'm in the process of documenting everything in wunderpy. Information on the API, as well as the classes provided by wunderpy are documented with sphinx.

To generate the documentation:

    cd docs
    make html # other options are available
    # look in the docs/build/html dir for the documentation

Running Tests
-------------

I'm working on writing tests for everything.

If you want to run said tests, make sure you have nose and nose-testconfig installed. Next, setup an ini config somewhere (I use the project root) that looks something like this:

    [login]
    email = test@email.web
    password = password

Now you can run the tests from the project root like this:

    nosetests --tc-file test_config.ini
