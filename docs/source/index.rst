What is Wunderpy?
=================

Wunderpy is a python package that aims to provide access to the `Wunderlist <https://www.wunderlist.com>`_ API.

As of this writing (9/13), Wunderlist doesn't have a public, documented API. This means that I've had to rely exclusively on reverse engineering the Wunderlist application (OS X Desktop) to figure out how to use it. Thus, it's quite possible that things will change unexpectedly and break everything.

That being said, wunderpy does some things differently from the official client. Presently, it doesn't send any client information (OS version, client version, etc). Currently wunderpy *cannot* login with Facebook.
